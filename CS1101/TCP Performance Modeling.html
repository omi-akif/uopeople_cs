<h2>TCP Self-Clocking and Bandwidth Estimation</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

We propose a simple queueing model for TCP transfers sharing a
bottleneck link and examine its behavior when the buffer at the
bottleneck is large compared to the bandwidth-delay product.  This
model explains some behaviors of TCP that have already been observed,
and predicts other behaviors that are new.  We present measurements
that demonstrate the predicted behaviors in the current Internet.

<h2>An empirical model of TCP performance</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

We propose a model of TCP performance that captures the behavior of a
set of network paths with diverse characteristics.  The model uses
more parameters than others, but we show that each feature
of the model describes an effect that is important for at least some
paths.  We show that the model is sufficient to describe the datasets
we collected with acceptable accuracy.  Finally, we show that the
model's parameters can be estimated using simple, application-level
measurements.
