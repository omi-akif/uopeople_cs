A computer program is a sequence of instructions to perform a mathematical or symbolic computation.




Example: This is @ well-structured Engli$h sentence with invalid t*kens in it. This sentence all valid
tokens has, but invalid structure with.

Think of computers as good employees and you think of yourself as good managers.

There are two types of langauge: 1) Formal Langauge, 2) Natural Language

Tokens are the most basic elements of a language.

Syntax is the most basic structure of a language. The process of understanding the structure is known as parsing. 

>>> 1, 1, 2
(1, 1, 2)  --> This is a tuple.



Exercise 1.1

1. In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?

Answer: 

>>> print('hello world'
...
...
...)
hello world

>>> print 'hello world')
Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('hello world'))?


2. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks,
or both?

Answer: 

>>> print('hello world)
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal


>>> print(hello world')
SyntaxError: invalid syntax


3. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus
sign before a number? What about 2++2?

>>> +2
2

>>> +-2
-2

>>> ++2

>>> 2++2
4

4. In math notation, leading zeros are ok, as in 02. What happens if you try this in Python?

>>> 02
SyntaxError: invalid token

5. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?

>>> 2 6
SyntaxError: invalid token

>>> '2' '6'
'26'



0x --> Hexadecimal
0b --> Binary
0o --> 

42 * 60 + 42
